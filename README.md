# Iâ€™m Zoe. Known on GitHub as @zydridas.
Iâ€™m interested in coding, process improvement and kitchen knife sharpening. Tell me about your kitchen knives. 


Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS, Python and recently I've dived into Powershell Scripting tools.


Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on websites! You can reach me via email <zoetsullivan@gmail.com> ðŸ“« and lets see what we can make!
