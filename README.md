### Iâ€™m Zoe and welcome to my GitHub landing page
---
I was previously known on GitHub as *zydridas* however I've made the decision to change my name to *Zoe-Moment*. I am still in the thick of updating my profile so I apologize in advance if there are any broken links due to the username change. Iâ€™m interested in coding, process improvement and kitchen knife sharpening. It's a weird mix but it's the mix that brings me joy. Computers, organizing/optimization and tools. That is Zoe in a nutshell. 

Currently, I am enrolled in [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). These two websites provide free self-led coding classes. After completing the web development modules I plan to either complete their Python training or look into a free training option for Powershell Scripting tools. 

If you are also moving forward on your own self-led coding journey lets chat and help eachother through the blocks that everyone will eventually run into! You can reach me via email <zoetsullivan@gmail.com> ðŸ“« Looking forward to talking with you!
