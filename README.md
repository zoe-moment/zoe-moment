### Iâ€™m Zoe
#### Welcome to my GitHub landing page
---
I was previously known on GitHub as *zydridas* however I've made the decision to change my name to *Zoe-Moment*. There is a fun backstory to that name and it's much easier for others to type and/or say. My new goal is to get my account up to date with my new username by July of 2022.


Iâ€™m interested in coding, process improvement and kitchen knife sharpening. Tell me about your kitchen knives. 


Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS, Python and recently I've dived into Powershell Scripting tools.


Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on websites! You can reach me via email <zoetsullivan@gmail.com> ðŸ“« and lets see what we can make!
