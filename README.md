### Iâ€™m Zoe and welcome to my GitHub landing page

#### Talk to me about your HTML sematics and accessibility!

At work I find myself drawn to process improvement, streamlining work flows and accesibility. 

At home I'm interested classic sci-fi and kitchen knife sharpening. It's a weird mix but it's the mix that brings me joy. 

Computers, organizing/optimization and tools. That is Zoe in a nutshell. 

Currently, I am enrolled in [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). These two websites provide free self-led coding classes. After completing the web development modules I plan to either complete their Python training or look into a free training option for Powershell Scripting tools.

If you are also moving forward on your own self-led coding journey lets chat and help each other through the blocks that everyone runs into!

Check out some of my projects!
